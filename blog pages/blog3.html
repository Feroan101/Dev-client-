  <h2>What is Quantum Computing?</h2>
  <p>
    Quantum computing is a new paradigm of computation that harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to process information. 
    Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits, which can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously through superposition.
  </p>
  <p>
    Entanglement and quantum tunneling enable quantum computers to solve certain problems exponentially faster than traditional machines. 
    Though quantum computers are still in their early stages, they promise to revolutionize how we tackle complex calculations.
  </p>

  <h2>Applications and Impact</h2>
  <p>
    Quantum computing could disrupt industries such as pharmaceuticals, by simulating molecules to develop new drugs faster; finance, by optimizing investment strategies; and cryptography, by cracking existing encryption methods.
    Researchers are also exploring quantum optimization for logistics, weather forecasting, and material science.
  </p>
  <p>
    Companies like IBM, Google, and startups like Rigetti are racing to achieve quantum supremacy — the point where quantum computers outperform the most advanced classical systems.
  </p>

  <h2>Challenges Ahead</h2>
  <p>
    Building stable quantum computers requires solving massive engineering problems, such as maintaining qubit stability (coherence) and reducing errors during computations.
    Scientists are working on error-correcting codes and developing better quantum materials to make practical, scalable quantum devices a reality.
  </p>

  <h2>Quantum Future</h2>
  <p>
    While large-scale quantum computing is still years away, progress continues rapidly. As the technology matures, it could unlock scientific breakthroughs 
    and redefine the boundaries of what’s computationally possible.
